# Code Examples

Some example code organized by language that I have written for various assignments and projects.

## Microprocessor Video Game
**Language:** C (embedded design utelizing freeRTOS)

**Description:** I wrote a "space invaders"-style 2D game controlled by tilting a circuit board. I used an accelerometer read by an ADC to control the movement of a character along 2 axes. The code runs in real time using an RTOS to handle scheduling and resource sharing.  

## Single Cycle Pipelined Processor
**Language:** Verilog (standard)

**Description:** I implemented a design for a single cycle processor with 5 stages and then utelized pipelines to increase the performance.
